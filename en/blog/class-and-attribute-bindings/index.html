  <div id="ember2187" class="blogPost-summary ember-view"><p>The straightforward way of applying dynamic class/attribute bindings to a component is within that component's class definition. For build-in and third-party components that would require subclassing, which is often undesirable. It's tempting to pass the bindings from a parent template without subclassing, but that works not how you think it works.</p>

<p>Every Ember developer has done this many times:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="js language-js hljs">Ember.Component.extend({
  <span class="hljs-attr">validationResult</span>: Ember.computed(<span class="hljs-comment">/*...*/</span>),
  <span class="hljs-attr">classNameBindings</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'validationResult:is-valid:is-invalid'</span>]
})</code></pre></div>
<p>Ember will apply either <code>is-valid</code> or <code>is-invalid</code> HTML class to the component depending on whether <code>validationResult</code> property is truthy.</p>
<p>In this case, the <code>validationResult</code> property is looked upon the component.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-pass-classnamebindings-externally" class="headingWithLink"><a href="#trying-to-pass-classnamebindings-externally" class="headingWithLink-link">#</a>Trying to pass <code>classNameBindings</code> externally</h2>
<p>There are situations when you want to pass <code>classNameBindings</code> into a component from the parent template.</p>
<p>Say, you need a custom HTML class on the <code>{{textarea}}</code> component, but you don't want to bother subclassing the <code>Ember.TextArea</code> component. Why create a custom component when you can simply pass <code>classNameBindings</code> and <code>validationResult</code> into the standard <code>{{textarea}}</code>, right?</p>
<p>This is what my intuition tells me to do, but it <strong>does not work</strong>:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars hljs"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{textarea
  validationResult  = (gte myText.length 100),
  classNameBindings = 'validationResult:is-valid:is-invalid'
}}</span><span class="xml"></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="what-happens" class="headingWithLink"><a href="#what-happens" class="headingWithLink-link">#</a>What happens</h2>
<p><code>classNameBindings</code> is operated by Ember's <strong>deprecated</strong> binding mechanism. The mechanism is documented <a href="http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Binding.html">here</a> and is removed in Ember 3.</p>
<p>Historically, this low-level API was used to set up bindings in EmberJS. Then it was replaced with the convenient high-level API that we know today, and instead of <code>myPropBinding='foo'</code> we can simply do <code>myProp=foo</code> in our templates. Note that the former uses quotes and the latter doesn't.</p>
<p>This code:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars hljs"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{textarea
  classNameBindings = 'validationResult:is-valid:is-invalid'
}}</span><span class="xml"></span></code></pre></div>
<p>is roughly equivalent to this:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars hljs"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{textarea
  classNames = (<span class="hljs-builtin-name">if</span> validationResult 'is-valid' 'is-invalid')
}}</span><span class="xml"></span></code></pre></div>
<p>But if you use the latter in your template, the HTML class will not be dynamic. It will use the initial value of <code>validationResult</code>, and when <code>validationResult</code> changes, the HTML class will not be updated.</p>
<p>This is why <code>classNameBindings</code> is there for you.</p>
<h2 id="passing-classnamebindings-into-the-default-textarea-component" class="headingWithLink"><a href="#passing-classnamebindings-into-the-default-textarea-component" class="headingWithLink-link">#</a>Passing <code>classNameBindings</code> into the default textarea component</h2>
<p>You have to define the property on the <em>parent</em> component/controller and use its name in <code>classNameBindings</code>:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="js language-js hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// app/components/parent-component.js</span>
Ember.Component.extend({
  <span class="hljs-attr">validationResult</span>: Ember.computed(<span class="hljs-comment">/*...*/</span>),
})</code></pre></div>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars hljs"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-comment">{{! app/components/parent-component.hbs }}</span><span class="xml">

</span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{textarea
  classNameBindings = 'validationResult:is-valid:is-invalid'
}}</span><span class="xml"></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It is very important to understand that this example is different from the first example in this article, even though it feels identical to <code>classNameBindings: 'validationResult:is-valid:is-invalid'</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the first example of this article, <code>classNameBindings</code> is evaluated in the context of the same component that it's applied to.</p></li>
<li><p>In this example, <code>classNameBindings</code> is applied to the <code>{{textarea}}</code> component, but it is evaluated in the context of the parent component/controller!</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="passing-multiple-properties-into-classnamebindings-externally-seems-to-be-impossible" class="headingWithLink"><a href="#passing-multiple-properties-into-classnamebindings-externally-seems-to-be-impossible" class="headingWithLink-link">#</a>Passing multiple properties into <code>classNameBindings</code> externally seems to be impossible</h2>
<p>I assumed this would work, but it doesn't:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars hljs"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{textarea
  classNameBindings = (array 'validationResult:is-valid:is-invalid')
}}</span><span class="xml"></span></code></pre></div>
<p>…where <code>array</code> is a simple helper that returns its arguments as an array.</p>
<p>I did not find a way to pass more than one property into <code>classNameBindings</code>. If you need that, you'll have to subclass the component in question, so that you can apply <code>classNameBindings</code> internally, in the component's own JS file.</p>
<p>Luckily, there's a better way.</p>
<h2 id="use-class-instead-of-classnamebindings-in-the-parent-template" class="headingWithLink"><a href="#use-class-instead-of-classnamebindings-in-the-parent-template" class="headingWithLink-link">#</a>Use class instead of classNameBindings in the parent template</h2>
<p>The <code>class</code> property, unavailable (or at least not documented) inside a component class, can be passed externally. And it allows defining multiple dynamic bindings!</p>
<p>You've probably done that many times:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars hljs"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"foo </span></span></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{bar}}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string"> </span></span></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{<span class="hljs-builtin-name">if</span> baz 'quux' 'zomg'}}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">"</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you pass <code>class</code> to a component, you need concatenation:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars hljs"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{my-component
  class = (concat 'foo ' bar (<span class="hljs-builtin-name">if</span> baz ' quux' ' zomg'))
}}</span><span class="xml"></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note extra spaces in string literals.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-attributebindings" class="headingWithLink"><a href="#what-about-attributebindings" class="headingWithLink-link">#</a>What about attributeBindings?</h2>
<p>Ember (Glimmer?) explicitly forbids passing <code>attributeBindings</code> from inside a parent tempalte. This will crash your app:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars hljs"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{my-component
  attributeBindings = "foo"
}}</span><span class="xml"></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Some Ember addons use a mixin that binds all properties passed from parent template to HTML attributes. With such a mixin, you could do this:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code class="handlebars language-handlebars hljs"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{my-component
  disabled = isDisabled
  data-foo = "bar"
}}</span><span class="xml"></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here's how a private mixin <code>dynamic-attribute-bindings</code> from <code>ember-one-way-controls</code>[<a href="https://github.com/DockYard/ember-one-way-controls/blob/v3.0.1/addon/-private/dynamic-attribute-bindings.js](looks">https://github.com/DockYard/ember-one-way-controls/blob/v3.0.1/addon/-private/dynamic-attribute-bindings.js](looks</a> like):</p>

    set(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'attributeBindings'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.attributeBindings.concat(newAttributeBindings));
  }
});</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that this approach uses a blacklist. I. e. it would process any attribute that is not mentioned in <code>NON_ATTRIBUTE_BOUND_PROPS</code> (which is a concatenated property: if you try to override it, you will instead append to it).</p>
<p>You can adjust this logic to use a whitelist instead.</p>
